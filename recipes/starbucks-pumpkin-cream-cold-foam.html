        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
            Fall might not actually be in the air in many parts of the country,
            but it is at Starbucks. Despite the fact that the first day of fall
            occurs at the end of September, many people consider Starbucks'
            Pumpkin Spice Latte launch date as the unofficial start of the
            season.

            Starbucks obviously knows the power it has over autumn seeing as
            every year the brand releases a huge announcement dropping the date
            the fall drinks will return â€” plus, any new fall offerings. The PSL
            is the classic choice, of course, but there's another fall drink
            that has garnered a cult following amongst cold coffee drinkers:
            Pumpkin Cream Cold Brew.
        </p>
        <p>More specifically, the Pumpkin Cream Cold Foam topping.</p>
